    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have always been very active in sports growing up. For 10 years I participated in competitive gymnastics and played softball throughout high school. Working hard at the challenges I faced in each sport, I learned that dedication and hard work were key in accomplishing any of your goals.</p>
